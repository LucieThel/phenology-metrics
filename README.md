# phenology-metrics
R code to simualte phenology of births and evaluate four characteristics of phenology (timing, synchrony, rhythmicity, regularity). We implemented metrics previously published to characterize phenology of births in large herbivores literature.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW



1. File List: example.R, peakfinder.pl, phenology_metrics.R, simulation_birth_phenology_non_norm.R, simulation_birth_phenology_norm.R
This repository contains R codes to simulate phenology of births and to evaluate four characteristics of phenology (timing, synchrony, rhythmicity, regularity) thanks to metrics previously used to quantify phenology of births in large herbivores literature. These codes are used in the analyses of the work called “How to describe and measure phenology? An investigation on the diversity of metrics using phenology of births in large herbivores” (DOI: 10.1101/2021.05.17.444418), available on bioRxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.17.444418v3.





DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION



Run example.R code to execute the functions. See phenology_metrics.R, simulation_birth_phenology_norm.R and simulation_birth_phenology_non_norm.R codes for a detailed description of each function.
